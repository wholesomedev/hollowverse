/**
 * This component is used to execute an arbitrary asynchronous function (`props.load`)
 * **on the client** before rendering a component.
 * Unlike packages like `react-universal-component` and `react-loadable`, it is not
 * intended for executing the `load` function _synchronously_ on the server.
 * Instead, when called on the server, it acts like any regular React component and
 * will just return whatever its `children` function returns for `isLoading = false`,
 * i.e. the `load` function will never be called on the server.
 * 
 * Example use cases include: showing a loading indicator while importing the
 * Facebook comments plugin on the client and then waiting for comments to be rendered.
 * 
 * Note: although this component is using a type parameter,
 * TypeScript is still unable to infer types from component usage.
 * For now, the type of `result` passed to `children` is inferred as `{}` which
 * is compatible with anything
 * See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/18807
